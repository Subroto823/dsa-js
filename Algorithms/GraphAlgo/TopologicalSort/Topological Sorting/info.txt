Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with an in-degree of 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).
