/**
@Dijkstra (Adjacency Matrix)

    Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. (from Wikipedia)

    It's a Greedy algorithm and doesnâ€™t work for Graphs with negative weights.

    Time Complexity: O(V^2)
    Space Complexity: O(V)


    Dijkstra's Algorithm Applications

        To find the shortest path
        In social networking applications
        In a telephone network
        To find the locations in the map
