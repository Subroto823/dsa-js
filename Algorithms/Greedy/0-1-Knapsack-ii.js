 * 
 * What is the 0/1 Knapsack Problem?
 * 
 * We are given N items where each item has some weight and profit associated with it. We are also given a bag with capacity W, [i.e., the bag can hold at most W weight in it]. The target is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of profits associated with them is the maximum possible.Â 
 * 
 * Note: The constraint here is we can either put an item completely into the bag or cannot put it at all [It is not possible to put a part of an item into the bag].
