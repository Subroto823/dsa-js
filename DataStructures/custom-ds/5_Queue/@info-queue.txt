* Queue

    * The Queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out(FIFO)

     * The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed

     * A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end(rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/ head);

     * Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model


     * The Stack data structure supports two main operations

        # Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
        # Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection.

Queue Usage:
   # printers
   # CPU task scheduling
   # Callback queue in JS runtime


*** Circular Queue
   * The size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element
   
   * Also referred to as circular buffer or ring buffer and follows the FIFO principle

   * A circular queue will reuse the empty block created during the dequeue operation

   * When working with queues of fixed maximum size, a circular queue is a great implementation choice

Circular Queue Usage
   * Clock
   * Streaming data
   * Traffic lights
