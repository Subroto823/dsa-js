Binary Tree
    # A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
    # They are referred to as left child and right child.

BST - Binary Search Tree

    # A binary tree that has two following property
        # The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node
        # The value of each right node must be greater than the parent node
        (# Each node has at most two children.)

Binary Search Tree Operations :
    # Insertion - To add node to the tree.
    # Search - To find a node given its value.
    # DFS & BFS - To visit all nodes in the tree.
    # Deletion - To remove a node given its value.

BST Usage :
    # Searching
    # Sorting
    # To implement abstract data types such as lookup tables and priority queues
