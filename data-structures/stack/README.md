# Stack
The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out(LIFO)

   - The last element inserted in to the stack is first element to be removed

   - A stack of plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate to removed from the stack.


## Stack Operations
A stack supports the following primary operations:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and retrieve the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek/Top**: Retrieve the element from the top without removing it.


## Complexity
The time complexity of common stack operations:
- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek/Top: O(1)


# Stack Usage
- Browser history tracking
- Undo operation when typing
- Expression conversions
- Call stack in JS runtime
