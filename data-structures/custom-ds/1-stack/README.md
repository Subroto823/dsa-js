# Stack
* The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out(LIFO)

   * The last element inserted in to the stack is first element to be removed

   * A stack of plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate to removed from the stack.

   * stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model

   * The Stack data structure supports two main operations

      * Push, which adds an element to the collection
      * Pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection.

# Stack Usage
   * Browser history tracking
   * Undo operation when typing
   * Expression conversions
   * Call stack in JS runtime
