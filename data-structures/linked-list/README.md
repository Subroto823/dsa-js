# LinkedList (Singly LinkedList)
* A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes
* Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to next node
* The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
* Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity

# supports three main operation
* Insertion - to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index of the list
* Deletion - to remove an item given its index or value
* Search - to find an element given its value

# LinkedList Usage :
* All applications of both stacks and queues are applications of linkedlist
* Image viewer

 
Doubly LinkedList:
    # Each node contains the value field, the next node link, as well as a second link pointing to the previous node in the sequence
    
        # This makes insertion and removal at both ends possible in constant time complexity but at the expense of more space.
