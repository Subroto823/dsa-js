# Tabulation
It's all about building a table. 
Instead of doing it recursively, we do it iteratively by building a table.
    
We start by filling up a table and then figure out the solution to the problem based on the result on the table.

* It is a Bottom-up method. We start solving the problems from the base cases (bottom) and gathering answers to the top.

    # Tabulation  Recipe
    * 
        * visualize the problem as a table
        * size the table based on the inputs
        * initialize the table with default values
        * seed the trivial answer into the table
        * iterate through the table
        * fill further positions based on the current position
