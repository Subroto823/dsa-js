# Tree
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a simple way to organize data in a branched or hierarchical manner. 
A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
A tree doesn't contain any loops or cycles.


## Why Tree Data Structure
The tree data structure is valuable because it provides a hierarchical organization, facilitating efficient data retrieval and search operations. 
Trees are preferred over arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues when you need to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems, database indices, or structured data like XML. 
They excel at optimizing search and insertion operations in scenarios where data is organized hierarchically.


## Tree Terminologies:
- **Node**: A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.

- **Parent Node**: A node that is the immediate predecessor of any node is called a parent node.

- **Child Node**: A node that is an immediate successor of a node is called a child node.

- **Root Node**: A node from which the tree originates is called the root node. It doesn't have a parent node and is the topmost node of the tree.

- **Leaf Node**: Nodes that don't have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. They are the endpoints of each path in the tree.

- **Siblings**: Child nodes with the same parent are called siblings.

- **Ancestor Node**: An ancestor node is a node's parent's parent node or any higher-level ancestor in the tree.

- **Path**: A path is a sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another.

- **Degree**: The degree of a node is the total number of child nodes it has. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of any node in the tree.

- **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node. The depth of the root node is always zero.

- **Height**: The height of a node is the number of edges from the deepest leaf to that node. The height of the root node is the height of the tree.

- **Forest**: A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest. You can create a forest by cutting the root of a tree.


## Tree Traversal
Tree traversal is a process of systematically visiting and exploring all the nodes in a tree data structure. 

* A hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.
    - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Breadth First Search (BFS)


## Tree Usage

- File systems for directory structure
- A family tree
- An organizational hierarchy
- Document Object Model (DOM) representation in web development
- Chatbots for decision-making and conversation flow
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are used to parse and analyze code.


*In tree-related interviews, the questions usually revolve around specific tree types rather than generic trees. The key trees of interest are Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs).*
