# Dijkstra's Alogorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. (from Wikipedia)

* It's a Greedy algorithm and doesnâ€™t work for Graphs with negative weights. To handle graphs with negative-weight edges, we can use alternative algorithms like Bellman-Ford.


## Dijkstra's Algorithm Applications
* To find the shortest path
* In social networking applications
* In a telephone network
* To find the locations in the map
