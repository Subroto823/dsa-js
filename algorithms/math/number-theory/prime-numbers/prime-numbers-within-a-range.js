/*
While this approach works, it has a few downsides:

# Efficiency: The code checks each number from 0 to n for primality by testing its divisibility by all integers up to its square root. This results in a time complexity of approximately O(n âˆšn), which can become slow for larger values of n.

# Repetitive Primality Testing: The isPrime function performs primality testing for every number in the range, even for those that have already been identified as prime. This repetitive testing wastes computation. */
