# What is Recursion?
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

* Recursion is when a function calls itself.

# Why?
It's a great technique to simplify our solution

* if we find ourselves breaking down our problem into smaller versions of the same problem, then recursion is very useful


# A few points about recursion

* Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion

* Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution

* Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand.
