# What is combinatorics?
* Field of math concerned with counting things.


# Common questions
* Given N things, in how many ways we can arrange them?
* In how many ways can we do X?
* What is the shortest way to do Y?


# What is Combinations?
* a collection of things where the order does not matter.

* Combinations of [a, b, c]
    []
    [a]
    [b]
    [c]
    [a, b]
    [b, c]
    [a, c]
    [a, b, c]

    * Given a set of n things, there are 2^n possible combinations.


# What is Permutations?
* a collection of things where the order matters.

* Permutations of [a, b, c]

    [c, b, a]
    [b, c, a]
    [b, a, c]
    [c, a, b]
    [a, c, b]
    [a, b, c]
    
    * Given a set of n things, there are n! Permutations.
