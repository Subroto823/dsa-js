# Sorting and Searching

## Sorting

### What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging a collection of data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. It's a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in various applications, including data analysis, databases, and more.

### Importance of Sorting

- **Efficiency**: Sorting allows for efficient searching, as it enables algorithms like binary search.
- **Data Presentation**: Sorted data is easier to visualize and analyze.
- **Data Retrieval**: Databases and file systems often rely on sorting for quick data retrieval.
- **Algorithms**: Many algorithms, such as merge sort and quicksort, use sorting as a fundamental step.
