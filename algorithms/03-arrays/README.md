# Array Data Structure

An array is a fundamental and widely used data structure in programming. It's a collection of elements of the same (or different type), organized in a contiguous memory block.


## Features:

    * Homogeneous or Heterogeneous: In JavaScript, Arrays can store elements of the same type (homogeneous) or mixed types (heterogeneous).
    * Size: Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic; their size can change as elements are added or removed.
    * Indexed Access: Elements in an array are accessed using a zero-based index.


## Difference between Subarray, Subsequence and Subset

### Subarray
A subarray is a contiguous (adjacent) portion of an array. It is formed by selecting a range of elements from the array without changing their order. The key point is that the elements in a subarray must appear consecutively in the original array.

Example:
    For the array [1, 2, 3, 4], 
    the subarrays could be [1], [2], [3], [4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 2, 3], and [2, 3, 4].

2. Subsequence:
A subsequence is a set of elements from an array in which elements are not required to be adjacent. However, the order of elements must be maintained. In other words, you can skip some elements, but the relative order of the remaining elements matters.

Example:
For the array [1, 2, 3, 4], the subsequences could be [1], [2], [3], [4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], and [1, 2, 3, 4].

3. Subset:
A subset is a collection of elements from an array in which the order does not matter. A subset can include any combination of elements from the array, and it may or may not be contiguous.

Example:
For the array [1, 2, 3], the subsets could be [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3].

In summary:

    A subarray is a contiguous segment of elements.
    A subsequence is a sequence of elements where the order is preserved, but not all elements need to be adjacent.
    A subset is a collection of elements from an array, and the order doesn't matter.

Understanding the distinctions between these terms is crucial when solving array-related problems, as each concept has its implications on problem-solving strategies and algorithmic approaches.
